## WebSocket connections

For real-time data streaming and event subscriptions, you can use WebSocket endpoints:

### Base Mainnet

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| WebSocket Endpoint | `wss://mainnet.base.org` <br/>Rate limited and not for production systems. |

### Base Testnet (Sepolia)

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| WebSocket Endpoint | `wss://sepolia.base.org` <br/>Rate limited and not for production systems. |

:::info
WebSocket connections are useful when you need:
- Real-time block updates
- Event subscriptions (e.g., contract events, new transactions)
- Pending transaction monitoring
- Low-latency data feeds

For production systems, consider using a [node provider](/base-chain/tools/node-providers) with dedicated WebSocket support.

## Block explorers

### Flashblocks

[Flashblocks](https://www.flashblocks.xyz/) provides real-time visualization and analysis for Base blocks and transactions. It offers:

- Live block and transaction streaming
- Detailed transaction traces
- MEV analysis and detection
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

Flashblocks is particularly useful for developers building MEV-aware applications or analyzing on-chain activity in real-time.

<Note>
L1 & L2 protocol and network-related smart contract deployments can be found on the [Base Contracts](/base-chain/network-information/base-contracts) page.
</Note>


<Note>
For production systems, we recommend using a node from one of our [node partners](/base-chain/tools/node-providers), or [running your own Base node](/base-chain/node-operators/run-a-base-node).
